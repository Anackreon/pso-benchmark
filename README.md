# Particle Swarm Optimization

A custom implementation of the [Particle Swarm Optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_swarm_optimization) algorithm.

To demonstrate the algorithm, PSO executes on a randomly initialized swarm and optimizes it against four objective functions:
- Spherical
- Ackley
- Michalewicz
- Katsuura
